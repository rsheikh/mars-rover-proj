![alt text](src/main/resources/mars_rover.jpeg)

## Welcome to Mars!

### A place where rovers can be created and explore uncharted territory, pick up strange objects and become friendly with the aliens! 

#### _This is unfinished._

## Getting Started

* Download the code onto your machine from this repo.

* Open the project in your preferred IDE and run the Main class.

* The console will prompt you for information:

`Enter size of the Plateau (x,y):`

* Pass in values for the plateau size as comma-delimited co-ordinates e.g. 5,5

`Enter a name for your new rover:`

* Give your rover a cool name.

`Enter your landing position and facing direction (x, y, direction):`

* Pass in comma-delimited co-ordinates for where your new rover will land with a letter denoting the 
compass direction your rover will be facing e.g. 3,2,N

`Enter your instructions for the Rover:`

* Pass in directions for your rover to get moving e.g MMLM denoting move 2 spaces in the direction
the lunar is facing, rotate left, move 1 space again.

* You'll get an output similar to:

`Rover NosyParker has successfully landed at (1,2) facing E`

`Rover NosyParker is on the move and reached (3,3) facing N`
